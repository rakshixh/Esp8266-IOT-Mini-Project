## Problem Statement

Elderly people and the young ones being more prone to COVID19 need special attention and effective monitoring system.


## Methodology

➢ The system consists of temperature sensor and pulse sensor that measures
the patient's body temperature and pulse rate.
➢ The data received from these sensors is stored in cloud server (ThingSpeak)
through NODEMCU Wifi module.
➢ The NODEMCU WiFi module is provided with the power supply.
➢ Display of the stored data is accessed by the caretakers and doctors to monitor
patients.


### Components
#### Hardware

- NODEMCU (ESP8266)
- Temperature sensor(DS18B20)
- Bread Board
- Pulse sensor

#### Software

- Arduino compiler
- ThingSpeak(Cloud service)

### Data Used
- Temperature
- Pulse Rate

## Possible Outcomes
➢ The body temperature and pulse rate are measured from the
remote patient. The measured data is then given access to the
caretakers through the ThingSpeak cloud server.
